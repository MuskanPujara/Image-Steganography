# Image-Steganography
Developed an image steganography tool using Python to hide data within images by altering the least significant bits. Ensures hidden messages remain invisible to the human eye while maintaining image integrity, making it a secure option for covert communication.
Here’s a properly formatted `README.md` for your Image Steganography project:


Image Steganography Project

## What the Project Does

This project is a Python-based tool for image steganography, allowing users to securely hide secret messages within image files. By modifying the least significant bits (LSB) of pixel values, it embeds data into images while keeping the visual appearance unchanged, making it ideal for confidential information storage.

## Why the Project is Useful
Image steganography provides a secure way to conceal sensitive data within images, ensuring that the information remains hidden to anyone viewing the image. This project can be used for secure communication, digital watermarking, and storing information in a covert manner.

## How to Get Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-steganography.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd image-steganography
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the application**:
   - Execute the main Python script to start encoding or decoding messages within images.

## Usage
- **Encoding a Message**: Use the encoding function to insert a hidden message into a chosen image file.
- **Decoding a Message**: Use the decoding function to extract the hidden message from an encoded image file.
